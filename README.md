# Role-Based Token Manager

A comprehensive web application for managing Role-Based Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) on the Optimism network. This application allows administrators to create, mint, and burn role-based tokens for students and other participants.

## Features

### üè≠ Factory Management
- **Create Role Tokens**: Deploy new soulbound tokens for specific roles (e.g., Student, Instructor, Alumni)
- **Factory Overview**: View all deployed tokens and factory statistics

### ü™ô Token Management
- **Mint Tokens**: Issue role-based tokens to student addresses
- **Burn Tokens**: Remove tokens from student addresses (irreversible)
- **Token Information**: View detailed token information including role descriptions
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh of token data after transactions

### üìä Analytics Dashboard
- **Total Roles**: Number of different role types deployed
- **Active Roles**: Roles with current token holders
- **Total Supply**: Combined supply across all tokens
- **Transaction History**: Track all mint/burn operations

### üîê Security Features
- **Owner-only Operations**: Only factory owner can create tokens, only token owners can mint/burn
- **Soulbound Tokens**: Tokens cannot be transferred between addresses
- **Address Validation**: Proper Ethereum address validation for all operations
